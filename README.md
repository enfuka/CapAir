# CapAir

This is a simulated project that I was a part of during my summer internship. 95% of the front-end is written by me, I also contributed to the backend as well as the deployment process on AWS.

### [Live demo](https://www.tinyurl.com/flycapair)

A full-stack Web application for an airline and with a booking system

Includes a web front-end written using React, a Spring Boot back-end, ML based chatbot using Flask and nltk in Python and a normalized MySQL database 

Also uses third-party APIs such as Google Maps
